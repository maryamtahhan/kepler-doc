# Translation Quality Check Report: Kepler Metrics Reference

**Original:** `docs/kepler/design/metrics.md`
**Translation:** `docs/kepler/design/metrics.zh.md`
**Reverse Translation:** `docs/kepler/design/metrics.rev.md`

## Overall Assessment

✅ **EXCELLENT TRANSLATION QUALITY**

The Chinese translation demonstrates perfect accuracy for Prometheus metrics documentation. This highly structured technical reference maintains precision across all metric definitions, types, and descriptions.

## Detailed Comparison

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Prometheus Metrics Terminology**:
   - "COUNTER/GAUGE" → "COUNTER/GAUGE" (correctly preserved as technical terms)
   - "Cumulative metric" → "累积指标" (accurate monitoring concept)
   - "Energy consumption" → "能耗" (precise measurement term)
   - "Power consumption" → "功耗" (correct electrical engineering term)

2. **Metric Classification Excellence**:
   - "Node/Container/Process/VM/Pod metrics" → "节点/容器/进程/虚拟机/Pod 指标" (accurate system hierarchy)
   - "Active/Idle state" → "活动/空闲状态" (precise CPU state terminology)
   - "Joules/Watts" → "焦耳/瓦特" (correct SI units preserved)

3. **Label and Metadata Accuracy**:
   - All metric names preserved exactly (`kepler_node_cpu_watts`, etc.)
   - All label names unchanged (`container_id`, `pod_namespace`, etc.)
   - Constant labels properly distinguished from variable labels

### 📝 Technical Reference Excellence

1. **Structured Documentation**:
   - Consistent formatting across all metric definitions
   - Type/Description/Labels structure maintained perfectly
   - Hierarchical organization preserved (node → container → process → VM → pod)

2. **Measurement Units and Values**:
   - "Between 0.0 and 1.0" → "值在 0.0 和 1.0 之间" (precise range specification)
   - "Total user and system time" → "总用户和系统时间" (accurate CPU time concept)
   - "Constant '1' value" → "常量值为 '1'" (exact metric behavior description)

3. **System Integration Concepts**:
   - "Procfs" correctly preserved as Linux filesystem term
   - "Hypervisor" appropriately maintained for virtualization context
   - "Runtime" preserved as container runtime concept

### 🔍 Technical Elements Verified

- ✅ All metric names unchanged (critical for API compatibility)
- ✅ All label names preserved exactly
- ✅ Metric types (COUNTER/GAUGE) maintained
- ✅ Units of measurement accurate (joules, watts, seconds)
- ✅ Value ranges and constraints preserved

### 📊 Documentation Structure

1. **Reference Format**: Perfect consistency in metric documentation structure
2. **Categorization**: Clear separation of metric types by workload level
3. **Generation Note**: Tool attribution properly translated

## Recommendation

### ✅ APPROVED FOR PROMETHEUS METRICS REFERENCE

This translation achieves the highest standards for technical API reference documentation. The translation maintains complete compatibility with Prometheus metric conventions while providing clear Chinese explanations.

## Notes

- Perfect preservation of all technical identifiers critical for monitoring system integration
- Excellent balance between technical accuracy and Chinese readability
- Structured format ideal for reference documentation use
- No risk of API compatibility issues due to unchanged metric/label names
- Suitable for technical teams implementing Kepler monitoring in Chinese environments

This represents a gold standard for translating structured technical reference documentation.
