**Original:** `docs/kepler/usage/configuration.md`
**Translation:** `docs/kepler/usage/configuration.zh.md`
**Reverse Translation:** `docs/kepler/usage/configuration.rev.md`

## Overall Assessment

✅ **EXCELLENT TRANSLATION QUALITY**

The Chinese translation demonstrates exceptional technical accuracy while maintaining perfect formatting and code preservation. All technical concepts are appropriately translated for Chinese technical audiences.

## Detailed Comparison

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Technical Terminology Excellence**:
   - "Configuration" → "配置" (standard technical term)
   - "Command-line flags" → "命令行标志" (accurate technical translation)
   - "Monitoring" → "监控" (correct industry standard)
   - "Workloads" → "工作负载" (proper Kubernetes terminology)

2. **Complex Table Translation**:
   - Configuration flags table fully translated with technical accuracy
   - Parameter descriptions maintained
   - Default values and formats preserved exactly

3. **Code Block Preservation**:
   - All YAML configurations unchanged
   - Command-line examples preserved
   - Code comments properly translated in context

4. **Emoji and Formatting**:

   - Markdown headers and structure maintained
   - Admonition blocks properly formatted

### 📝 Translation Highlights

1. **Context-Aware Translation**:
   - "Staleness" → "过时" (appropriate for caching context)
   - "Terminated workloads" → "已终止工作负载" (precise technical meaning)
   - "Debug endpoints" → "调试端点" (correct networking terminology)

2. **Consistent Technical Vocabulary**:
   - "Exporter" consistently as "导出器"
   - "Metrics" consistently as "指标"
   - "Threshold" consistently as "阈值"

3. **Cultural Adaptation**:
