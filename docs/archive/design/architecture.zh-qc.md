# Quality Check Report: Chinese Translation of architecture.md

## Translation Assessment

This report compares the original English document with the reverse-translated version to assess translation quality.

## Overall Quality: ✅ HIGH QUALITY

The Chinese translation accurately preserves the technical meaning, structure, and formatting of the original document.

## Detailed Comparison

### Structure and Formatting

- ✅ **Headers**: Preserved perfectly (# Components, ## Kepler Exporter, ## Kepler Model Server)
- ✅ **Links**: All markdown links maintained with correct syntax and paths
- ✅ **Image**: Architecture diagram reference preserved exactly
- ✅ **Code elements**: Backticks, file paths, and socket paths preserved
- ✅ **Line spacing**: Consistent with original formatting

### Technical Terminology

- ✅ **Kubernetes terms**: "Pod" and "Nodes" correctly maintained in Chinese context
- ✅ **Technical components**: "Kepler Exporter", "Kepler Model Server", "Kepler Estimator" preserved
- ✅ **File references**: `estimator.go`, `/tmp/estimator.sock` maintained exactly
- ✅ **Technical concepts**: "Unix domain socket", "sidecar container", "main container" properly translated

### Content Accuracy

#### Kepler Exporter Section

- **Original**: "exposes a variety of metrics about the energy consumption"
- **Reverse**: "exposes various metrics about the energy consumption"
- ✅ **Assessment**: Semantically identical, minor word variation acceptable

- **Original**: "Monitor container power consumption with the [metrics](metrics.md) made available by"
- **Reverse**: "Monitor container power consumption through the [metrics](metrics.md) provided by"
- ✅ **Assessment**: "through...provided by" vs "with...made available by" - semantically equivalent

#### Kepler Model Server Section

- **Original**: "return a [power estimation model](../kepler_model_server/power_estimation.md) corresponding to the request containing target granularity"
- **Reverse**: "return a [power estimation model](../kepler_model_server/power_estimation.md) corresponding to requests that contain target granularity"
- ✅ **Assessment**: "the request containing" vs "requests that contain" - both grammatically correct

- **Original**: "update the model on the fly when power metrics are available"
- **Reverse**: "update models in real-time when power metrics are available"
- ✅ **Assessment**: "on the fly" vs "in real-time" - equivalent technical meanings

- **Original**: "This python will serve a PowerRequest"
- **Reverse**: "This Python module will handle PowerRequest"
- ✅ **Assessment**: "serve" vs "handle" - both appropriate for the technical context

## Technical Accuracy Verification

### Chinese Technical Terms Used
