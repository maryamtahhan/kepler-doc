# Translation Quality Check Report: ebpf_in_kepler.zh.md

## Overall Assessment
The Chinese translation of `ebpf_in_kepler.md` has **several significant issues** that affect technical accuracy and completeness.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **MISSING CONTENT** ❌
**Section completely missing**: "Calculate 'page cache hit'" (lines 126-128 in original)
- Original content about `kprobe__set_page_dirty` and `kprobe__mark_page_accessed` probe functions
- This is critical information about how Kepler tracks page cache hits
- **Impact**: High - Missing functionality explanation

### 2. **Incorrect File Path** ❌
- **Line 75**:
  - Original: `bpfassets/bcc/bcc.c`
  - Chinese: `bpfassets/perf_event/perf_event.c`
- **Impact**: High - Incorrect technical reference that could mislead developers

### 3. **Missing Table Entry** ❌
In the Process Table section, missing:
- Original includes `page_cache_hit | Total hit of the page cache` entry
- Chinese translation omits this entry entirely
- **Impact**: Medium - Incomplete technical documentation

### 4. **Case Sensitivity Error** ❌
- **Title**: "eBPF in Kepler" → "Kepler中的ebpf"
- Should be: "Kepler中的eBPF" (maintaining proper capitalization)
- **Impact**: Medium - Technical term formatting

### 5. **Technical Translation Issues** ⚠️

#### Section Headers:
- "Kernel Routine Probed by Kepler" → "kepler探测内核进程"
- Should be: "Kepler探测的内核例程" (more accurate)

#### Technical Terms:
- "context switch" → "上下文切换" ✅ (correct)
- "task switch" → "任务切换" ✅ (correct)
- "Performance counters" → "性能计数器" ✅ (correct)

### 6. **Minor Language Flow Issues** ⚠️
- Some sentences have awkward phrasing that could be improved
- Generally maintains technical accuracy despite flow issues

## Strengths
- ✅ All code blocks preserved correctly
- ✅ Technical table structure maintained
- ✅ Reference links preserved
- ✅ Most technical terminology correctly translated
- ✅ eBPF concepts explained appropriately for Chinese audience

## Translation Quality Score: 6.5/10

**Major deductions for:**
- Missing critical section (-2.0)
- Incorrect file path (-1.0)
- Missing table entry (-0.5)

## Recommendations

### **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1. **Add missing "Calculate 'page cache hit'" section**
2. **Correct file path from perf_event.c to bcc.c**
3. **Add missing page_cache_hit table entry**
4. **Fix title capitalization to eBPF**
5. **Improve section header translation**

### **Status: REQUIRES REVISION**
This translation needs significant updates before it can be considered accurate and complete. The missing content and incorrect file path are critical issues that must be addressed.
